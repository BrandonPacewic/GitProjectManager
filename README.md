# Linux Git Project Manager

Linux script for managing a large amount of git projects.

## Features

- Easy searching through projects.
  - With alphabetical sorting and tag filtering.
- Manager for checking out more than one branch at a time.
  - So there is no need to clone your projects twice to compare branches.
- Easy setup with a search for projects feature.
  - Simply set your directory to the root of all your projects and it does the rest.
- Automatic updating of projects.
  - So you never need to wounder if you are on the most recent version or not.

Clone the repository and run the install command:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

This project is still a work in progress. If you have any suggestions for features please raise an issue.
